			<h1>Smurf Me UK!</h1>
			<p><a href="https://smurf.me.uk/" title="Link to site home">Smurf.me.uk</a> is a list of resources to help new and existing Ingress Resistance players
			get started with Ingress, or to get more involved in their local actions. All information on this site is "public" information that is not considered
			a security risk to the Ingress Resistance Community, however, as you get more involved you will find there are other resources and information that is
			considered Secure Information that is only shared with Trusted Ingress Resistance Agents and <strong>must not</strong> be shared with The Enlightened</p>
			<p>Primarily, this site points at existing sources of information, however, there are a number of items which are original Smurf.me.uk content. These
			are considered to be released into the public domain, so you can do with them what you wish.</p>

				<dt><a href="https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/" title="FevGames Ingress Guide">FevGames Ingress Guide</a></dt>

			<h2>Top Tips</h2>
			<p>Try following these small pieces of advice to get going fast!</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Glphy Hack Everything</dt>
				<dd>At least hack every portal. But Glphy Hacking (long press to enable) gets you more Action Points and more gear.</dd>
				<dt>Learn the Glyphs</dt>
				<dd>Each glyph means something. As the portals get higher level, more Glyphs appear as you hack it. These form phrases. If you
				know the meaning of each Glphy it's easier to remember and get the sequence right. So if you know that the Glphys spelled out "Attack Enlightened Defend Resistance" it'll be easier to get them right and get more kit and AP from the portal.</dd>
				<dt>Max AP</dt>
				<dd>Every action earns you AP, each Resonator you add to a portal is a bit. But you get bonus AP for the first and last resonator, plus liking and fielding is more.
				So if you're in an area you can do it, make sure you full deploy, link and field as many portals as you can to level fast.</dd>
				<dt>Get More Keys</dt>
				<dd>Once two portals are fully deployed, you can link from one to the other. When standing at the first portal, you must have a key for the second. If you
				hack or glyph hack a portal there is a random chance it will drop one key. You can get more by drawing the "more" Glyph on the Glyph hack screen before it
				starts to show you the Glyph sequence for that hack. More keys, more links, more fields, more AP, more levels...</dd>
				<dt>Connect Locally</dt>
				<dd>Get involved in your local community, there are chat groups that will provide you with loads of help and advice!</dd>

			<h2>Official Resources</h2>
			<p>The following is a list of official Niantic resources that are part of the Ingress platform you should be aware of.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><a href="https://ingress.com/support" title="Ingress Support site">Ingress Support</a></dt>
				<dd>The official Ingress support site has many help articles and a mechanism for raising support tickets and issues with Niantic.</dd>
				<dt><a href="https://intel.ingress.com/" title="Ingress Intel Map">Intel Map</a></dt>
				<dd>The Ingress Intel Map provides the ability to look beyond what you can see in your scanner and see the bigger picture. It allows you to look and see anywhere in the world, what portals are there, if they're deployed, linked, modified etc. It's all there.</dd>

		<article id="unofficialResources">
			<h2>Unofficial Resources</h2>
			<p>The tools provided by Niantic are somewhat limited, there are many more tools made by the community to help improve your Ingress experience. You should be very careful using third party tools, as some break the rules of Ingress and are considered cheating. The following tools are generally accepted as safe.</p>
				<dt><a href="https://www.agent-stats.com">Agent Stats</a></dt>
				<dd>This uses screenshots of your agent profile in Ingress to track your progress against in-game and expanded targets. Great when you're chasing your next levels!</dd>
				<dt><a href="https://www.iitc.me">IITC</a><dt>
				<dd>IITC provides expansion of the Ingress Intel map to unlock it's potential</dd>
				<dt><a href="http://glyphtionary.com/">Glyphtionary</a></dt>
				<dd>A Glyph Dictionary to help you learn the glyphs!</dd>
